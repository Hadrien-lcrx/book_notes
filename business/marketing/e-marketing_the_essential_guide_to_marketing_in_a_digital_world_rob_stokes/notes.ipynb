    "\n",
    "### Understanding marketing strategy\n",
    "**Business strategy** asks:\n",
    "- what is the business challenge we are facing that prevents us from making more revenue?\n",
    "- what business objective should we strive for in order to increase the money in the bank?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **brand** justifies:\n",
    "- why the business matters\n",
    "- what the business' purpose is\n",
    "- what value the business adds to people's lives\n",
    "\n",
    "The **value of a brand** is measures in terms of its brand equity:\n",
    "- how aware are people of the brand?\n",
    "- does it hold positive associations and perceived value?\n",
    "- how loyal are people to the brand?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **marketing strategy**:\n",
    "- determines what the business is about\n",
    "- addresses the business, brand challenge or objective that has been revealed\n",
    "\n",

    "- what are the factors that affect the business?\n",
    "  - environment\n",
    "  - business\n",
    "  - customers\n",
    "  - competitors\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Understanding the environment\n",
    "- the environment is the overall context in which the business functions, form global economics to specific industry developments\n",
    "- it is usually analyzed using a PESTLE analysis:\n",

    "  - social\n",
    "  - technological\n",
    "  - legal\n",
    "  - environmental\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Understanding the business\n",
    "- what does the brand stand for?\n",
    "- what does the brand mean?\n",
    "- what associations, ideas, emotions and benefits do people associate with it?\n",
    "- what makes it unique?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several levels of branding, summarized in the brand pyramid template:\n",
    "- brand idea: the essence of your brand\n",
    "- brand/product persona: the manifestation of the brand in human characteristics\n",
    "- emotional benefits: how does your product/service make the consumer feel?\n",
    "- functional benefits: summarizes the tangible benefits to the consumer\n",
    "- features/attributes: tangible assets of your product or services focusing on the most desirable/differentiating features\n",
    "\n",
    "These interrogations help determine the brand or product's unique selling point (USP):\n",
    "- what unique value does the product or service has?\n",
    "- does it solve a product that no other product does?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding customers\n",
    "- market research helps understand customers: do not make assumptions about why people like and transact with your brand.\n",
    "- consumer journey consists in the series of steps and decisions a customer takes before buying from your business\n",
    "- online data analytics help help get a good picture of consumer behavior\n",
    "- consumer journey is not linear: the goal is to reach customers with the right marketing message at the right stage of their journey (e.g. aspirational messages in the exploration phase, direct features and benefits when they're almost ready to buy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding competitors\n",
    "- who else is marketing to your potential customers?\n",
    "- what do they offer?\n",

    "- digital should not be considered as separate from your core strategy\n",
    "- a marketing strategy should be constantly iterating and evolving\n",
    "- the internet allows for near-instantaneous feedback and data gathering, so marketers should constantly be optimizing and improving their online marketing efforts\n",

    "- digital marketing is highly empirical: everything can be measured (e.g. behaviors, actions, action paths, results)\n",
    "- a testing framework and the ability to remain flexible and dynamic should be built into any strategy\n",
    "- the desired outcome of the digital marketing strategy should be aligned with your organization's overall business and brand-building objectives or challenges (e.g if an objective is acquiring new clients, a possible digital marketing strategy might build brand awareness online)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The building blocks of marketing strategy\n",

    "  - online promotion can be tracked, measured and targeted in a far more sophisticated way\n",

    "  - what goal, purpose or outcome are we looking for?\n",
    "  - what are you trying to achieve?\n",
    "  - how will you know if you're successful?\n",
    "  - objectives need to be SMART:\n",
    "    - specific: the objective must be clear and detailed rather than vague and general\n",
    "    - measurable: the objective must be measurable so that you can gauge whether or not you are attaining the desired outcome\n",
    "    - attainable: the objective must be something that is possible for your brand to achieve, based on available resources\n",
    "    - realistic: the objective must also be sensible and based on data and trends: don't exaggerate or overestimate what can be achieved\n",
    "    - Time-bound: the objective must be linked to a specific timeframe\n",
    "- Goals\n",
    "  - what do we need users to do in order to achieve our objective\n",
    "  - a goal is an action that a user takes or a type of user behavior (e.g. making a purchase, signing-up for a newsletter, viewing a certain number of pages)\n",
    "  - a completed goal is called a conversion\n",
    "  - goals related to visitor behavior (e.g. time spent on site or page views per visit) are called engagement goals\n",
    "- Tactics\n",
    "  - tactics are the specific tools or approaches used to meet objectives (e.g. a retention-based email newsletter, a Facebook page, or a CRM implementation)\n",
    "  - tactics may change and often should but the objective should remain the focus\n",
    "- Key performance indicators (KPIs)\n",
    "  - what data do we need to look at to see if goals are being completed?\n",
    "  - KPIs are metrics that are used to indicate whether tactics are performing well and meeting your objectives\n",
    "- Targets\n",
    "  - targets are the specific values that are set for your KPIs (e.g. 100 subscriptions every month)\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Tactics and evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "| Tactic | Outcome |\n",
    "|--------|---------|\n",
    "| **SEO**: The practice of optimizing a website to rank higher on search engine results pages for relevant search items. Involves creating relevant, fresh and user-friendly content that search engines can index to serve it for relevant search terms. | **Customer retention and acquisition**: SEO plays a key role in acquisition: it ensures the organization's offering appears in search results, allowing it to reach customers. A site optimized for search engines is also clear, relevant and well-designed: they contribute to a good user-experience, and therefore SEO also plays a role in retention. |\n",
    "| **Search advertising**: also called pay-per-click, the advertiser pays only when someone clicks on their ad. The ads appear on search engine results pages. | **Sales, customer retention and acquisition**: search advertizing is keyword based: ads come up in response to the search terms entered by a consumer. It therefore plays a role in sales, acquisition and retention. It allows advertisers to reach people already in the buying stage, or expressing an interest in the offer.\n",
    "| **Online advertising**: Covers advertising in all areas of the internet (e.g. ads in emails, ads on social networks and mobile devices and displays ads in normal websites). | **Branding and acquisition**: The main objective is to raise brand awareness online. It can be more interactive / less disruptive that traditional static advertising, and users can choose to engage or not. It can be targeted for specific locations, subject areas, past user behavior, and more. |\n",
    "| **Affiliate marketing**: System of rewards whereby referrers are given a finder's fee for every referral they give. | **Sales and branding**: Affiliate marketing is used widely to promote e-commerce websites, with the referrers being rewarded for every customer provided through their efforts. Useful for brand building and acquisition. |\n",
    "| **Video marketing**: Creating video content, whether for video advertising or more valuable, useful content marketing. | **Branding, customer retention and value creation**: the interactive and engaging aspects of video marketing make it efficient at capturing and retaining customer attention. It can provide tangible value in terms of information, entertainment or inspiration, and boost a brand's image. |\n",
    "| **Social media**: Media in the form of text, visuals and audio that can be shared online. Allows collaboration and connection in a way no other channel has been able to. | **Branding, value creation and participation**: Social media is useful for brand building, raising awareness about the brand and its story, and encouraging customers to become involved. Shareable and accessible, social media allows brands to communicate and engage with their customers, and interact with them instead of simply broadcasting to them. |\n",
    "| **Email marketing**: A form of direct marketing that delivers commercial and content-based messages to an audience. One of the most powerful digital marketing tactics as it is extremely cost-effective, highly targeted, customizable on a mass-scale and completely measurable. | **Customer retention and value creation**: A tool to build relationships with customers through valuable content and promotional messages, email marketing should maximize retention and value of these customers: A targeted / segmented email database means that a brand can direct messages at certain sectors of their customer base. |\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the objectives and tactics have been set, they should be cross-checked and re-evaluated against the needs and resources of the organization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ongoing optimization\n",
    "- the process of constant change should be considered early in strategy formulation, ensuring tactics and strategies can be modified and optimized as you go\n",
    "- budget should be set aside upfront for analyzing user data and optimizing conversion paths, helping better understand the consumers and their journeys\n",
    "- using social media efficiently can help inform strategic decisions in the organization from product roadmaps to service plans\n",
    "- data collected around the success of the marketing strategy should feed into a larger pool of information used to drive business decisions"

    "## 02 - Understanding customer behavior\n",
    "- marketing is an exercise in applied human psychology\n",
    "- success requires a nuanced understanding of how people think, process and choose within their environment\n",
    "- one must be aware of global shifts, impacts on people's behavior, and intimate motivations determining where individuals spend time and money\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key terms and concepts\n",
    "- **Attention economy**: The idea that human attention is a scarce commodity, seeing attention as a limited resource.\n",
    "- **Customer experience map**: A visual representation of the customer's flow from beginning to end of the purchase experience, including their needs, wants, expectations and overall experience.\n",
    "- **Customer persona**: A detailed description of a fictional person to help a brand visualize a segment of its target market.\n",
    "- **Global citizen**: A person who identifies as part of a world community and works towards building the values and practices of that community.\n",

    "- **Product**: An item sold by a brand.\n",
    "- **Story**: A narrative that incorporates the feelings and facts created by your brand, intended to inspire an emotional reaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding customer behavior\n",
    "- the study of consumer behavior draws on several disciplines: psychology, economics, anthropology, sociology, marketing...\n",
    "- understanding why people make the decisions they do forms part of a complex ongoing investigation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key digital concepts influencing customer behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The impact of digital\n",
    "- digital tools and media destabilized the status quo: all industries are vulnerable when a competitor meets user needs in an unprecedented way (e.g. Netflix, Airbnb, Uber)\n",
    "- half the world population has no idea what a world without Internet is like\n",
    "- the Internet seeks no middlemen\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The global citizens and their tribe\n",
    "- the Internet has created a space for people to create, form, support and evolve their own niche communities\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The attention economy\n",
    "- it's increasingly difficult to get the attention of those you are trying to reach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools for understanding your customer\n",
    "#### Developing user personas\n",
    "- a user persona is a description of a brand-specific cluster of users who exhibit similar behavioral patterns (e.g. in their purchasing decisions, use of technology or products, customer service preferences and lifestyle choices)\n",
    "- desktop research (e.g. drawing from existing reports, benchmarking studies) helps to frame the questions you need to ask when delving deeper into the data available\n",
    "- a combination of habits and specific needs are combined into a usable overall picture\n",
    "- a robust persona considers demographics, psychographics and motivators from the customers\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Demographics and psychographics\n",
    "There are two facets to understanding customers:\n",
    "- understanding the physical facts, context and income of their \"outer world\" / demographics (e.g. culture, sub-culture, class, class structure in which they operate)\n",
    "- understanding the motives, desires, fears and other intangible characteristics of the \"inner world\" / psychographics (e.g. motives, how they learn, attitudes)\n",
    "- demographics can be laborious to acquires but are generally objective and unambiguous data points that change within well-understood and measurable parameters\n",
    "- psychographics are fluid, complex and deeply personal as they relate to the human mind - this information is very hard to define, but complementary fields working together can uncover a goldmine of insights\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Understanding motivation\n",
    "**Extrinsic motivators**\n",
    "Extrinsic motivators are external, tangible pressures, rewards, threats or incentives that motivate us to taker action even if we don't necessarily want to. Such extrinsic motivators in marketing are:\n",
    "  - limited-time specials and discounts: the customer is motivated by a perceived cost-saving and the urgency of acting before the offer is revoked\n",
    "  - scarcity: the limited availability of a product or service is used to encourage immediate action\n",
    "  - loyalty programmes: coupons, exclusive access or free gifts are extrinsic rewards in exchange for people performing desired behaviors\n",
    "  - ancillary benefits: a side benefit granted in exchange of an action (e.g. free parking at the shopping center if you spend over a certain amount at a specific store)\n",
    "  - free content or downloads: in exchange for contact details, often used for subsequent marketing activities\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three risks to extrinsic rewards:\n",
    "- extrinsic rewards encourage people to focus narrowly on a task, to do it as quickly as possible and to take few risks\n",
    "- people come to see themselves as being controlled by the reward: they feel less autonomous, which may interfere with performance\n",
    "- extrinsic rewards can erode intrinsic interest: people who see themselves as working for money, approval or competitive success find their tasks less pleasurable and don't do them as well\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intrinsic motivators**\n",
    "Intrinsically motivated people perform an action for an intangible benefit simply because they want to, for the pleasure, fun or happiness of it. Common forms of intrinsic motivation include:\n",
    "- love: romantic love, love of an activity or outcome\n",
    "- enjoyment and fun: desire to have a good time is a powerful motivator\n",
    "- self-expression: acting in a certain way because of what it feels like, or what one feels the action says about them\n",
    "- personal values: values instilled through cultural, religious, social or other means can be powerful motivators\n",
    "- achievement or competence: people challenging themselves, taking a meaningful personal risk, attaining a long-desired goal are acting because of an intrinsic motivation\n",
    "- negative intrinsic motivators: fear, embarrassment, inertia are powerful drivers relying on negative emotions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Finding the right motivators**\n",
    "- is the incentive you are offering truly relevant and useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision making and behavioral economics\n",
    "##### Biases \n",
    "**Cognitive biases**\n",
    "Cognitive biases are our own prejudices and preferences, as well as common ways of thinking that are inherently flawed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Information bias*\n",
    "\n",
    "| Bias | Explanation |\n",
    "|------|-------------|\n",
    "| Knee-jerk bias | Making a quick decision in a circumstance where slower, more precise decision-making is needed. |\n",
    "| Occam's razor | Assuming that an obvious choice is the best one. |\n",
    "| Silo effect | Using a narrow approach to form a decision. |\n",
    "| Confirmation bias | Only focusing on the information that confirms your beliefs, and ignoring invalidating information. |\n",
    "| Inertia bias | Acting in a way that is familiar or comfortable. |\n",
    "| Myopia bias | Interpreting the world around you in a way that is purely based on your own experiences and beliefs. |\n",
    "\n",
    "*Ego bias*\n",
    "\n",
    "| Bias | Explanation |\n",
    "|------|-------------|\n",
    "| Loss aversion bias | Tending to favor choices that avoid losses, at the risk of potential gains. |\n",
    "| Shock-and-awe bias | Believing that our own intelligence is all we need to make a difficult decision. |\n",
    "| Overconfidence effect | Having too much confidence in our beliefs, knowledge and abilities. |\n",
    "| Optimism bias | Being overly optimistic and underestimating negative outcomes. |\n",
    "| Force field bias | Making decisions that will aid in reducing perceived fears or threats. |\n",
    "| Planning fallacy | Incorrectly judging  the time and costs involved in completing a task. |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pricing bias**  \n",
    "We perceive more expensive items to be better and derive more pleasure from them even if the cheaper alternative is just as good.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Loss aversion**  \n",
    "The negative felling associated with loss is far stronger than the positive feeling of gaining the equivalent thing (losing $200 is more painful than gaining $200 is pleasurable).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Heuristics**  \n",
    "A heuristic is a decision-making mental model that helps us make sense of a difficult decision-making process or to estimate an answer to a complex problem, such as:\n",
    "- availability heuristic: we overemphasize the likelihood or frequency of things that have occurred recently because they come to mind more easily\n",
    "- representativeness heuristic - we consider a sample to represent the whole, for example in cultural stereotypes\n",
    "- price-quality heuristic: more expensive things are considered higher quality, and higher price leads to higher expectations. If quality is measurable, then price needs to correlate with quality; but for more subjective experiences, price can increase the perceived quality.\n",
    "- anchoring and adjustment heuristic: making decisions based on relative and recent information rather than broad, objective fact.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Choice\n",
    "People decide based on irrational factors and motivators, objective needs and their immediate circumstances.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Word of mouth / peer suggestions**\n",
    "We are very susceptible to the opinions of other people and tend to trust the opinions of friendsm family, experts and people like us over companies or brands.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Personal preferences / history**  \n",
    "We base some of our decisions on personal factors such as favorite colorm a positive past experience, or a historical or familial association.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Habits**\n",
    "We buy the same thing because we've always bought it and it's the  easiest option. Habits unfold in a sequence:\n",
    "- habits are usually triggered by a cue (an outside or environmental factor)\n",
    "- the cue causes us to take an action (acting on our habit)\n",
    "- taking the action provides us with a reward (positive boost)\n",
    "\n",
    "In marketing, the goal is to get a customer to form a habit loop around purchasing or using the brand's offering.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Some brands encouraging habit formation*\n",
    "| Brand | Cue | Routine | Reward |\n",
    "|-------|-----|---------|--------|\n",
    "| Starbucks | Walking to work in the morning | Get my regular coffee order | A caffeine hit and a friendly interaction with the barista |\n",
    "| Nike | Mobile app reminder to go for a run | Put on Nike shes, go to the gym | Endorphins, satisfaction at lving a healthy aspirational lifestyle |\n",
    "| Movie theatre | Smell of popcorn | Buy a snack set from the counter | Tasty snack, experiencing the \"full\" movie experience |\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a habit, you need to perform a repeated action many times in a row. The harder the action, the longer and more consistently you need to practice the behavior. Once the habit is set, it becomes a mental shortcut that will take conscious effort to override in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision load**\n",
    "Making decisions is hard even if the decision is a low-stakes, low-impact one. After a certain threshold, we suffer of decision fatigue. This is why is why many industry captains cut out as many trivial decisions as possible. This is also why we tend to eliminate unnecessary decisions and stick to reliable tested habits (especially in the fast moving consumer goods sector, e.g. toothpaste).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Defaults**\n",
    "Having a default option is a powerful decision-making shortcuts. It removes the need to make an active decision. A default option:\n",
    "- offers a path of least resistance, if it is perceived by the majority as good enough for the least amount of thought\n",
    "- serves as a social signal, if it is seen as the socially approved option\n",
    "- offers assurances, if it was selected by an expert because of its merit to the end user\n",
    "- takes advantage of loss aversion, as effective default packages often include more products or services, anchoring the price of the default package and providing less incentive to remove the additional products\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choice architecture**\n",
    "The customer's decision-making process can be simplified with a a clever choice design:\n",
    "- a small number of choices, usually not more than five, ideally three\n",
    "- a recommended or default option\n",
    "- a visual design hierarchy, typically using color and size\n",
    "\n",

    "### Understanding data\n",
    "#### Consumers, technology and data\n",
    "Consumers don't adapt to technology changes, as much as they are leading the change themselves through the technological choices they make. They decide which technology to embrace, favoring whtever facilitates speed and ownership of their own experience, especially on mobile.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The internet of me\n",
    "Consumers use the IoT technology to communicate, create content (e.g. social media posts), consume and share products. The Internet of Things is also the Internet of Me: the technology-enabled connection between objects and the consumer allows brands to access data they could never have considered a few years ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is data?\n",
    "Data is all the information about your business, including:\n",
    "- your consumers\n",
    "- your products\n",
    "- their performance\n",
    "- your owned digital properties\n",
    "- any other information that might affect your business\n",
    "\n",
    "Data helps you:\n",
    "- create a strong data-driven business strategy\n",
    "- connect with consumers\n",
    "- sell more products\n",
    "\n",
    "Data collection and use aims at creating value:\n",
    "- value is defined as any means through which the brand delivers on its purpose\n",
    "- it needs to be something the customers want or that is relevant to them\n",
    "- it can help identify what is relevant, what is useful and what really works\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Forms of data\n",
    "1. Algorithmic intelligence: the algorithmic methods used by companies to help drive revenues (e.g. the Google algorithms to assess what people want to read, or the Netflix algorithms to assess what people want to watch)\n",
    "2. Business intelligence (BI): the technology-driven process for analyzing an organization's raw data about profits and performance and presenting that information to help brands make better informed business decisions\n",
    "3. Customer intelligence (CI): information derived from customer data, coming from internal and external sources, enabling the brand to build better customer relationships and make stronger strategic decisions\n",
    "4. Software intelligence (SI): software tools and techniques used to mine data for useful and meaningful information to help brands make better informed business decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sources of data\n",
    "- online data, e.g. social media, email, forums and everywhere your audience interacts with you online\n",
    "- databases, e.g. contact database, CRM, loyalty program\n",
    "- software data, e.g. user habits, crashes, problems, usage information\n",
    "- app store data, e.g. customer downloads, payments, app usage\n",
    "- offline data, e.g. in-store experience, customer service logs, in-person surveys, in-store foot traffic\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Dash provides both convenience to customers and data for granular segmentation to Amazon.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lagging, current and leading indicators\n",
    "A data-driven, customer-first strategy should be built around three indicators:\n",
    "1. Lagging indicators: past data informing about past performance (e.g. financial results, sales history, past campaign results)\n",
    "2. Current indicators: pieces of information from right now, informing your agility in response to them (e.g. website analytics, but also immediate environment, such as public response to a new policy)\n",
    "3. Leading or future indicators: data that help define a strategy to move forward (e.g. searches for established players, innovations, economic and environmental data)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approaching data\n",
    "#### Enabling dynamic data\n",
    "- customers expect personalized communication, and and personalization is all about relevance\n",
    "- data helps you understand your customers\n",
    "- data should be collected and stored in a single place that can be accessed by everyone: multiple datasets within a business pose a risk to customer communication, especially when they lead to irrelevant or outdated information\n",
    "- business should aim for a single view of customer (SVOC)\n",
    "- data needs to be dynamic as customer preferences, and therefore relevance, changes over time (e.g. political or product preferences, marital status)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data customer and strategy\n",
    "Customer-centrism revolves around five principles:\n",
    "1. You are not the customer\n",
    "2. Your brand does not know the customers as well as they know themselves\n",
    "3. Customers are all different\n",
    "4. Customers are constantly changing\n",
    "5. Data drives the customer-centric view\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data and trust\n",
    "Customers are increasingly concerned about privacy. Trust has three components:\n",
    "1. Security: customer data must be protected from theft and hack\n",
    "2. Privacy: the brand must be compliant with legal requirements in terms of what data can be collected and how it can be used (e.g. European Union Data Protection Directives, EU's General Data Protection Regulation, South Africa's Protection of Personal Information Act, Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, UK's Data Protection Act, California Consumer Privacy Act), and a privacy policy outline must be easily accessible to the consumer\n",
    "3. Transparency: consumers should have insight into how their data is being used, and the brand should demonstrate how providing customers access to their data contributes to an improved experience for them\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with data\n",
    "#### Reporting\n",
    "Gathering data is just the beginning. You need to report on that data to the people who will act on it, in a format that will actually be consumed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Who is going to receive your data and what format works best for them?\n",
    "- the CEO focuses on ROI\n",
    "- the digital manager focuses on site and channel performance\n",
    "- the channel manager focuses on content performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the scope of legal requirements, organization should place no restrictions on who can or cannot see existing data: the more people have access, the more improvements can be facilitated. Data takes the emotion out of decisions: the fact that everyone can access the data you are presenting moves the organization to a customer-centric viewpoint and nullifies the impact of opinions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analyzing data\n",
    "The feedback loop nurturing a dynamic view of customer data never stops and enables the search for patterns, similarities, trends, deviations, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Becoming a data-led organization\n",
    "A data-driven business needs people who obsess about data and a culture that puts data and the customer first.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of such an organization could look like this:\n",
    "- Chief Experience Officer\n",
    "    - Chief Customer Officer\n",

    "        - Trust task force\n",
    "        \n",
    "Several steps need to happen (not necessarily in order) for a business to become data-driven, revolving around three main areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Internal preparation\n",
    "The organization needs to:\n",
    "- understand and validate the financial and emotional investment required to become data-driven\n",
    "- gather and analyze collective data (e.g. how and where customers are connected, through what channels and with which devices)\n",
    "- appoint a cross-functional team leading the customer experience strategy, involving customer officers and data officers\n",
    "- architect the best toolset to drive and support the changing customer experience\n",
    "- dedicate people and processes to monitor the three components of trust\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Customer focus\n",
    "The organization needs to:\n",
    "- identify granular segments within its user base\n",
    "- update its consumer engagement processes and governance strategy \n",
    "- shift towards a world where every customer has a unique view of its product\n",
    "- start mapping relevant user journeys that leverage new channels of access to the consumer\n",
    "- use collective data to map the journey\n",
    "- consider customer touchpoints and feedback loops\n",
    "- use the data in part of the feedback loop to map the change in the customer journey\n",
    "\n",
    "#### External evaluation\n",
    "The organization needs to:\n",
    "- evaluate competitors for their use of data influencing their personalization strategy\n",

    "\n",
    "A data-driven organization faces the following challenges:\n",
    "- be data-driven in everything (no picking and choosing)\n",
    "- persuade the entire organization to adopt this mindset\n",
    "- set up an organization structure enabling the data to flow easily\n",
    "- invest in the cycle and in data to apply the insights that will help it get more data\n",
    "- keep in mind that the huge amount of data available can make finding meaningful patterns tricky\n",

    "Although it's useful to benchmark against competitors to see where the organization stands in its industry, it's necessary to benchmark against the organization's own previous performance to ensure the brand is continuously improving. More technical aspects should be measured against industry standards (e.g. page load times). Similarly, the time the organization takes to respond to consumers or to make a sale should be measured against universal benchmarks for similar reasons: the customers have come to expect a certain standard that, if not met, will result in a negative customer experience.\n",
