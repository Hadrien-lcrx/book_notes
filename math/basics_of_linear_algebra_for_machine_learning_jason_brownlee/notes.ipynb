    "## 01 - Introduction to linear algebra\n",
    "### Linear algebra\n",
    "Linear algebra is about linear combinations: using arithmetic on columns of numbers (vectors) and arrays of numbers (matrices) to create new columns and arrays of numbers. It's been formalized in the 1800s to find unknowns in systems of linear equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "A linear equation is a series of terms and mathematical operations where some terms are unknown, for example:  \n",
    "$y = 4 x + 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "They are called linear equations because they describe a line on a two-dimensional graph. We can line up a system of equations with two or more unknowns:  \n",
    "- $y = 0.1 x_{1} + 0.4 x_{2}$  \n",
    "- $y = 0.3 x_{1} + 0.9 x_{2}$  \n",
    "- $y = 0.2 x_{1} + 0.3 x_{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- the column of $y$ values is a column vector of outputs from the equation\n",
    "- the two columns of float values are the data columns $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$ forming the matrix $A$\n",
    "- the two unknown values $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ are the coefficients of the equation and form a vector of unknowns $b$ to be solved\n",
    "\n",
    "summarized in linear algebra as:  \n",
    "$y = A \\cdot b$\n",
    "\n",
    "Such problems are challenging to solve because:\n",
    "- there are usually more unknowns than there are equations to solve\n",
    "- no single line can satisfy all of the equations without error\n",
    "\n",
    "Interesting problems are often described by system with an infinite number of solutions. This is the core of linear algebra as it relates to machine learning. The rest of the operations are about making such problems easier to understand and solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numerical linear algebra\n",
    "Implementations of vector and matrix operations were initially implemented in FORTRAN with libraries such as:\n",
    "- LAPACK\n",
    "- BLAS\n",
    "- ATLAS\n",
    "\n",
    "Popular packages used nowadays in Python for example build on top of these libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear algebra and statistics\n",
    "- using vector and matrix notation (multivariate statistics)\n",
    "- solving least squares and weighted least squares (linear regression)\n",
    "- estimating means and variance of data matrices\n",
    "- using the covariance matrix (multinomial Gaussian distributions)\n",
    "- leveraging the concepts above for data reduction with principal component analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications of linear algebra\n",
    "- matrices in engineering (line of springs)\n",
    "- graphs and networks (graph analysis)\n",
    "- Markov matrices, population, economics (population growth)\n",
    "- linear programming (simplex optimization method)\n",
    "- Fourier series - linear algebra for functions (signal processing)\n",
    "- linear algebra for statistics and probabilities (least squares for regression)\n",
    "- computer graphics (translation, rescaling, rotation of images)"
